# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in Action Potential. All forms of contribution are
welcome, from issue reports to PRs and documentation / write-ups.

* We use node.js v3 for development and testing.

Before you open a PR:

* See README.md for setup instructions
* If you're planning to add or change a major feature in a PR, please ensure
the change is aligned with the project roadmap by opening an issue first,
especially if you're going to spend a lot of time on it.
* Be careful to follow the code style of the project.
* Ensure that your effort is aligned with the project's roadmap by talking to
the maintainers, especially if you are going to spend a lot of time on it.
* Make sure there's an issue open for any work you take on and intend to submit
as a pull request - it helps core members review your concept and direction
early and is a good way to discuss what you're planning to do.
* If you open an issue and are interested in working on a fix, please let us
know. We'll help you get started, rather than adding it to the queue.
* Where possible, include tests with your changes, either that demonstrates the
bug, or tests the new functionality. If you're not sure how to test your
changes, feel free to ping @onejgordon
