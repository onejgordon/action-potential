# Action Potential

An experimental, ultra-lightweight decision app for distributed teams (or anyone)

## Setup

* `pip install -r requirements.txt -t lib`
* Create a src/js/config/base.json file from src/js/config/base.template.js from Firebase web credentials.

## Libraries / Technologies

* https://github.com/tylermcginnis/re-base
* https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/
* ReactJS
* MaterialUI

## Todo

- Deleting of proposals / resources, pros/cons
- More visual custom metric display
- Weighting metrics (& pros/cons?)
- Un-voting for pros/cons
- Tallying winning proposal
- Non-metrics based proposal voting (?)
- Merge options
- Export to gSheet
- Show list of decisions contributed to as well (indexes?)
